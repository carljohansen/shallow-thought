# Shallow Thought
Demonstration of a chess playing engine in Angular 15.  Please see [here](https://carljohansen.wordpress.com/2017/06/26/shallow-thought-an-angular-2-chess-player/) for an in-depth discussion of the code.

## Introduction
This is a bit of fun to show some Angular concepts PLUS a chess engine - all in one package.  In homage to 'Deep Thought' (the granddaddy of chess engines) and in honest recognition of my engine's feeble playing strength, I have named it Shallow Thought.  I hope you enjoy playing around with it as much as I enjoyed building it.

Since this is primarily a learning exercise, it's accompanied by a series of articles that will hopefully explain what's happening (see link above).

Here's a screenshot showing Shallow Thought (Black) getting pounded by Houdini (White)!

### Disclaimer
This is my first serious attempt at using Angular 15.  Coming from a Visual Studio background, this project was also my first use of the following:
* Node.js
* Npm
* Webpack
* Git
* RxJS
* Web workers (i.e. browser background threads)

I hope it's clear: this is not a masterclass in any of the above (or in writing chess engines, for that matter).  Your comments and suggestions are welcome.

## Building
This project is based on the [Angular 2 seed](https://github.com/angular/angular2-seed), so if you have followed the steps and can build and run that project then you should be in pretty good shape to run Shallow Thought.
