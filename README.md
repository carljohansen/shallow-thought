# Shallow Thought
Demonstration of a chess playing engine in Angular 2.

## Introduction
This is a bit of fun to show some Angular 2 concepts PLUS a chess engine - all in one package.  In homage to 'Deep Thought' (the granddaddy of chess engines) and in honest recognition of my engine's feeble playing strength, I have named it Shallow Thought.  I hope you enjoy playing around with it as much as I enjoyed building it.

### Disclaimer
This is my first serious attempt at using Angular 2.  Coming from a Visual Studio background, this project was also my first use of the following:
* Node.js
* Npm
* Webpack
* Git
* RxJS
* Web workers (i.e. browser background threads)

I hope it's clear: this is not a masterclass in any of the above (or in writing chess engines, for that matter).  Your comments and suggestions are welcome.
